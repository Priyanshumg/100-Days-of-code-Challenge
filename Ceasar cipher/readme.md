# Ceasar Cipher
**The most oldest types of encryption which was considered as military level Encryption**
So before the modern and advance level of encryption got introduced, The great kings used this technique to communicate with other kings without a data leak. <br />
## **How it works??**
Well Lets say we have a message to send to a king  <br />
Say Message is **"enemies are on their way"**
So the Ecrypted Message will look like **"Lultplz hyl vu aolpy dhf"** <br />
<br />
Can you understand what above message is written without looking at the original message<br />
so to decode this message you have to shift each letter in the alphabets by a number of 7, and it's nnot neccessary that it has to be 7.
### Lets consider "ENEMIES"
so when we shift each Alphabet in ENEMIES by 7 we get, LULTPLZ <br />
so Every time you send an encrypted message you have to also share a shift number <br />
And thats how they communicate
