# Blackjack Capstone
We all have played blackack once in our life time, if not here let me explain you <br />
Black Jack is a game where two players are or mmore are involved, and players compete among with each other against the dealer <br />
so in this project game, we arent competing a player but we are competing a computer dealer<br />

## Rules of the Game
Rule 1 : Every Player will be given 2 cards from a random deck<br />
Rule 2 : If dealer has cards which values more than 21 than the dealer loses and player wins <br />
Rule 3 : If player has cards which values more than 21 than the player loses and dealer wins <br />
Rule 4 : if Dealer has cards which value less than 17 than dealer will pick a card<br />
Rule 5 : Ace can be considered as 1 or 11<br />
Rule 6 : Player and Dealer will get 2 cards in start 

## Game
Basically game starts with 2 cards with each player(Dealer and Player). <br />
Now the computer asks user if he wants a card or not, User have to decide. <br />
Now once user say yes the dealer will give a card randomly from the deck. <br />
if no the total_value function will compare the total value of the decks that dealer has and player's. <br /> 
Now the function decides who will win by comparing it with rules and will display the ans.
